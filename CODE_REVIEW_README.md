# Code Review Workflow - Assignment 5

## Automated Code Review Process

**File**: `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`

---

## Overview

This workflow automates code review tasks and provides comprehensive feedback on pull requests before they can be merged.

### Triggers:
- **Pull Request opened** to main branch
- **Pull Request updated** (new commits pushed)
- **Pull Request reopened**

---

## Workflow Jobs

### 1. 📋 Code Standards Check

**Purpose**: Enforce coding standards and style guidelines

**Actions**:
- ✅ Runs ESLint on all code
- ✅ Checks indentation, quotes, semicolons
- ✅ Identifies unused variables
- ✅ Validates code formatting
- ✅ Posts results as PR comment

**Output**:
```
📋 Code Standards Check
✅ No errors found!
OR
⚠️ Please fix linting errors
```

**Required to Pass**: YES - Blocks merge if errors found

---

### 2. 📊 Code Quality Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyze code quality metrics and maintainability

**Checks**:
- ✅ Runs all tests
- ✅ Analyzes code complexity
- ✅ Counts lines of code
- ✅ Validates file structure
- ✅ Posts quality metrics as comment

**Metrics Provided**:
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Files analyzed count
- Lines of code count
- Quality recommendations

**Required to Pass**: YES - All tests must pass

---

### 3. 🔒 Security Vulnerability Scan

**Purpose**: Identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies

**Actions**:
- ✅ Runs `npm audit`
- ✅ Scans all dependencies
- ✅ Categorizes vulnerabilities (critical, high, moderate, low)
- ✅ Provides fix recommendations
- ✅ Posts security report as comment

**Severity Levels**:
- 🔴 **Critical**: Immediate action required
- 🟠 **High**: Fix before merge
- 🟡 **Moderate**: Fix soon
- 🟢 **Low**: Monitor

**Required to Pass**: WARNING - High/Critical vulnerabilities block merge

---

### 4. ✅ PR Review Summary

**Purpose**: Consolidate all check results

**Actions**:
- ✅ Waits for all checks to complete
- ✅ Creates summary table
- ✅ Shows pass/fail for each check
- ✅ Provides next steps
- ✅ Sets final PR status

**Summary Includes**:
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Code Standards | ✅/❌ |
| Code Quality | ✅/❌ |
| Security Scan | ✅/❌ |

---

## How It Works

### When You Create a PR:

```
1. Open Pull Request
   ↓
2. Code Review Workflow Triggers
   ↓
3. Four Jobs Run in Parallel:
   - Code Standards ➜ Posts comment
   - Code Quality ➜ Posts comment
   - Security Scan ➜ Posts comment
   ↓
4. PR Review Summary Created
   ↓
5. Status: ✅ Ready to Merge or ❌ Needs Fixes
```

---

## PR Comments

### Example Comments on Your PR:

#### Code Standards Comment:
```markdown
## 📋 Code Standards Check

✅ No errors found!
```

#### Code Quality Comment:
```markdown
## 📊 Code Quality Metrics

✅ Tests: All tests passed
📈 Code Analysis: Completed
🔍 Files Checked: 3 JavaScript files

Recommendations:
- Maintain test coverage
- Keep functions small
```

#### Security Comment:
```markdown
## 🔒 Security Scan Results

✅ No vulnerabilities detected!

Vulnerability Summary:
- Critical: 0
- High: 0
- Moderate: 0
- Low: 0

Status: All dependencies are secure
```

#### Final Summary:
```markdown
## ✅ Code Review Summary

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Code Standards | ✅ success |
| Code Quality | ✅ success |
| Security Scan | ✅ success |

### ✅ All checks passed! This PR is ready for review.

Next Steps:
- Request review from team members
- Address any review comments
- Merge when approved
```

---

## Required Checks Before Merge

### Mandatory Checks:
1. ✅ **Code Standards** - Must pass ESLint
2. ✅ **Tests** - All tests must pass
3. ✅ **No High/Critical Vulnerabilities** - Security check

### Optional/Warning:
- ⚠️ **Moderate/Low Vulnerabilities** - Can merge with note

---

## Integration with GitHub

### Branch Protection Rules:

To enforce these checks, set up branch protection:

1. Go to: `Settings → Branches`
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - ☑️ Require status checks to pass
   - ☑️ Require branches to be up to date
4. Select required checks:
   - ☑️ Code Standards
   - ☑️ Code Quality Analysis  
   - ☑️ Security Vulnerability Scan

### This Ensures:
- ❌ Cannot merge if checks fail
- ✅ Code quality maintained
- 🔒 Security vulnerabilities caught
- 📋 Standards enforced

---

## Testing the Workflow

### Create a Test PR:

1. **Create a new branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b test-pr
```

2. **Make a small change**:
```bash
echo "// Test change" >> test.js
git add test.js
git commit -m "Test PR for code review"
git push origin test-pr
```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
   - Base: `main`, Compare: `test-pr`
   - Click "Create pull request"

4. **Watch the Workflow**:
   - Go to "Actions" tab
   - See "Code Review" workflow running
   - Check PR for automated comments

---

## Customization Options

### Add More Checks:

You can add additional jobs to the workflow:

**Code Coverage**:
```yaml
- name: Check code coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage
```

**Performance Testing**:
```yaml
- name: Run performance tests
  run: npm run test:performance
```

**Documentation Check**:
```yaml
- name: Verify documentation
  run: npm run docs:check
```

---

## Workflow Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Read code
  pull-requests: write  # Comment on PRs
  issues: write         # Update PR status
  checks: write         # Create check runs
```

These permissions allow the workflow to:
- ✅ Read your code
- ✅ Post comments on PRs
- ✅ Update PR status
- ✅ Create check results

---

## Troubleshooting

### PR checks not running?
**Solution**: 
- Ensure PR targets `main` branch
- Check workflow file syntax
- Verify permissions are set

### Comments not appearing?
**Solution**:
- Check `pull-requests: write` permission
- Verify GitHub token has access
- Look for errors in workflow logs

### Checks always fail?
**Solution**:
- Run `npm run lint` locally first
- Run `npm test` locally
- Fix issues before pushing

---

## Best Practices

### For Contributors:

1. ✅ **Run checks locally** before creating PR:
```bash
npm run lint    # Check standards
npm test        # Run tests
npm audit       # Check security
```

2. ✅ **Fix issues immediately** when workflow comments appear

3. ✅ **Keep PRs small** - Easier to review and faster checks

4. ✅ **Write tests** for new features

### For Reviewers:

1. ✅ **Wait for checks** to complete before reviewing
2. ✅ **Review automated feedback** first
3. ✅ **Focus on logic** - automation handles style
4. ✅ **Approve only** when all checks pass
