## 📋 Assignment Overview
**Course Learning Outcome**: CLO 4 - Implement Version Control Systems  
**Student**: [Your Name]  
**Project**: Heavens Above Web Scraper  
**Repository**: [Your GitHub URL]

---

## 🎯 Objective
Establish an automated CI pipeline that validates code quality and functionality on every code change.

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Configuration

### Workflow Details
- **Filename**: `ci.yml`
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/`
- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Runtime**: Ubuntu + Node.js

### Trigger Events
- 🔔 **Push events** to main branch
- 🔔 **Pull request** events targeting main branch

## 🔧 Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Repository Setup
```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```
*Purpose*: Downloads latest codebase

### Stage 2: Environment Preparation  
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
```
*Purpose*: Configures Node.js v18 environment

### Stage 3: Dependency Management
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
```
*Purpose*: Installs project dependencies

### Stage 4: Quality Assurance
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test
```
*Purpose*: Executes test suite

### Stage 5: Build Verification
```yaml
- name: Build project
  run: npm run build
```
*Purpose*: Validates project build process

### Stage 6: Status Reporting
```yaml
- name: Success notification
  run: echo "CI completed (linting skipped)"
```
*Purpose*: Final status communication
